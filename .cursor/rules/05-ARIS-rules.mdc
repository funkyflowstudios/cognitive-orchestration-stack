# Agent Behavioral Rules

```markdown

- The project's virtual environment is named 'venv', not '.venv'. When executing commands, always use the correct path (e.g., `venv/bin/python` or `venv\Scripts\python.exe`).
- Before using any module, verify that it is correctly installed in the 'venv' environment and properly imported. Do not assume its existence.
- Never hallucinate or assume the existence of files or directories. Always verify paths against the current project structure before attempting to read from or write to them.
- All newly implemented functions, classes, and modules must be accompanied by appropriate tests to ensure correctness and stability.
- Maintain a clear log of the development progress. At the end of each major phase or task, provide a concise summary of what was completed.
